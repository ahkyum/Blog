        <h3 class='line'>Today I recreated our apartment's plan with Adobe Illustrator, so we can announce the sale of the apartment on the internet. </h3>
  
  <p>What I was given are the paper with an old plan before remodeling and some information about how I should change the plan.</p>

        <p>Then I put given plan in illustrator and straighten it.</p>
        <p>I put the opacity at less than 50%.</p>
        <p>Then I redrew original plan, following the gray lines, that's what I've got.</p>
  <p>After that I changed the plan according to the new remodeling information and put numbers measuring the square and distance.</p>
